# SeleniumPractice
Just a practice that I did where I automated three test cases for the site automationpractice.com using Selenium and TestNG frameworks.

# The Test Cases
I made three test cases where I different real user flow scenarios. 

For the first one I followed a simple Sign in and Sign out check to see if the user is able to sign in with valid credentials, if hes then on the right profile and if he can successfully sign out from his account. 

Second test case focus on the user being able to select and item from the shop and successfully complete his order while registered. 

Third test case revolves around an unregistered user wanting to buy an item and going throu the registration process and completing his order at the end. 

For more details on the test cases you can preview them here. (Link)
